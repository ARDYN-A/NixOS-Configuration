# My NixOS Desktop Configuration Files

I am trying to keep the configuration simple.

I use the shell script to copy files from the git repository to the default NixOS configuration folder and then upgrade the system.

If you are attempting to use these Nix files, do not forget to generate a personal hardware file.
